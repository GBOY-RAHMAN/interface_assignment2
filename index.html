       <p>[Intro]</p> 
       <p class="intro">
Sittin' in the Phantom, countin' money in the sun
Everybody in my hood know I'm the one
Made it out the trenches, leave ten million for my son
They said it's the difference, it feel different how I come   </p>


<p>[Chorus]</p>
<p>
<span class="sound">Put it on my soul,</span> I can put it on my soul
We be goin' to the awards and I ain't puttin' up my pole
That new Virgil and Dior came through, I got it on
Put it on my soul, put it on my soul
Ain't nothin' that I, it ain't nothin' that I can't hold
I'm gettin' everything I aimed for
I'm gettin' everything I aimed for
Bulletproof the Range Rove', <span class="ni_g">ni**as</span>  be on angles
I done bought so many diamond chains, swear they get tangled
Promise any <span class="ni_g">ni**a</span> sayin' my name gon' get mangled (Boom)</p>

<p>[Verse]</p>
<p>
Same <span class="ni_g">ni**as</span> 'round me gettin' changed and they dangerous
Different colored riches in the pictures, Power Rangers
Come to fuckin' these bitches and gettin' this cash, no, we ain't stainless
Two hundred on the dash, been through the hood like I ain't famous
Sometimes I just be havin' to vent though, I ain't gon' lie
A lot people still left here like
Everybody prayin' I don't go back, but it's like, what you want me to do?
And leave my people?
<span class="sound">And I can't leave my people, got that eye of the eagle</span>
My homie wanted the Bentley but he died in the Regal
And  <span class="ni_g">I ain't never sell no heroin</span> , auntie died from the needle
If you my opp, my daddy dyin' to meet you
'Cause I know the feeling when you <span class="ni_g">fu**ed </span> up and you lit
And nobody wan' see you, but when you come up and you rich
Everybody believe you, they use me too, <span class="sad">I got useless</span>
Think that's how I got even
Put my life on the line and sacrifice for my people
</p>

<p>[Chorus]</p>
<p>
Put it on my soul, I can put it on my soul
We be goin' to the awards and I ain't puttin' up my pole
That new Virgil and Dior came through, l got it on
Put it on my soul, put it on my soul
Ain't nothin' that I, it ain't nothin' that I can't hold
I'm gettin' everything I aimed for</p>


<p>[Outro]</p>
<p>
Yeah, I'm gettin' everything <span class="slowmo">(Everything)</span>
    Bulletproof the Range Rove', donut the Durango
Crazy all the shit that I obtain, I feel the same dose
My young <span class="ni_g">ni**a</span> died in the streets lettin' his flame go
And I think about it every night 'fore I sleep, it make my brain go
<span class="slowmo">(Thinkin' about it every night when I sleep)</span>
Got me cuddlin' with my Glock when I sleep, can't let my flame go<span class="close">
    (Got me cuddlin' with my Glock)
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Put it on my soul
</span>
